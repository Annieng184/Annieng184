Option 1:

WHERE lower(substr(city,length(city),length(city))) in('a','e','i','o','u')

#Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Option 1:

FROM   station
WHERE  city RLIKE '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$'

#Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
Option 1:
SELECT distinct city
FROM station
WHERE city not regexp '^[aeiou]'

Option 2:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY NOT RLIKE '^[aeiou]'

Option 3:
SELECT distinct city
FROM station
WHERE substring(city,1,1) not in('a','e','i','o','u')

#Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels
SELECT distinct city
FROM city
WHERE city not RLIKE '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$'

#Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels.
SELECT distinct city
FROM station
WHERE city rlike '^[^AEIOUaeiou].*[^AEIOUaeiou]$'
